    This sounds fine , I would recommend using RNAseq illumina pair-end from Matthias Uhlens group from 32 tissues as probably more extensive than Body Map.

    For mouse you could include Kaessmann data 76bp pair-end

    and encode mouse data 75bp pair-end from wold/gingeras and snyder lab would be fine
