    This sounds fine , I would recommend using RNAseq illumina pair-end from
    Matthias Uhlens group from 32 tissues as probably more extensive than Body
    Map.

    For mouse you could include Kaessmann data 76bp pair-end  (appears to be single-ended)

    and encode mouse data 75bp pair-end from wold/gingeras and snyder lab would be fine 

    This is human: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-2836/
