* tslGbffGetProblemCases should be run on cluster, drop multiprocessor mode.
* make clear genbank problem vs suspect (problem makes a gb suspect)
* should TSL not use RNAs with large initial/terminal unaligned sequence
  - coded added to evidFeatures.py, but currently ignored until TSL is validated
  - not clear if initial/terminal unaligned should be part of exon, as RnaInsertFeature,
    as now bounds preceeds rna coords in exon. Maybe unaligned should always be part of
    exons, not introns, maybe need a Gap StructureFeature.
* collect polyA predictions for RNA & eST
* add categories in previous TSL: code: mgcOrfeome, noStopClone
* what to do about the stop lists
* rename evidFeatures in objects to alignFeatures (although in analysis, it is still evidence)
* fine tune indel size based on where it occurs (UTR vs CDS), or weight now evidence
