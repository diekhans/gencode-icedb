2016-01-04 Adam:
    Are you able to calculate the percent spliced in (PSI) for each exon - see
    Dmitri's paper on this here (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23172860)
    - from the data you have. I think in the absence of full transcript level
    quantification this would be a very useful property to capture - e.g. an
    exon may be well-supported in a highly expressed gene but may be included
    in relatively few transcripts.
