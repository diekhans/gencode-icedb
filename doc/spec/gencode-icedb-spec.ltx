\section{Goals}
The goal of the Transcription Support Level (TSL) mechanism created for
GENCODE was to provide a simple, independent metric to answer the question
{\em how well supported is this annotation as transcribe in human.?}  

A short coming of the TSL approach was the inability to ask more detailed
questions about why something has a given level of support.  The goal of this
project is to address this shortcoming by building a database mapping evidence
to GENCODE annotations.  \todo{more}

\section{Data model}
single vs multi-exon transcripts
special cases
fuzzy ends and NAGNAG

Objects defined by GENCODE annotations:
\begin{tightitemize}
\item exon - includes NAGNAG annotations
\item intron - includes splice sites and NAGNAG annotations
\item transcript - linking introns and exons
\item gene - group transcripts
\item CDS - CDS regions of exons
\end{tightitemize}

Evidence mapped to GENCODE features:
\begin{tightitemize}
\item GenBank mRNA alignments
\item GenBank EST alignments to multi-exon genes
\item GenBank EST densities (wiggles) for single-exon genes
\item RNA-Seq 
\item protein spectra mapped to CDS
\end{tightitemize}



\section{Evidence sources}
\begin{tightitemize}
\item Human mRNAs:
\item Human ESTs:
\item RNA-Seq
\end{tightitemize}

\subsection{RNA-Seq evidence}

RNA-Seq mappings are analyzed to score support for introns (exon-pairs) in
GENCODE annotations.  In order to produce consistent mappings and analysis, 
selected RNA-Seq data is remapped to the genome using the GENCODE set as 
the target set.  The STAR \cite{Dobin25102012} mapper is use, which
has excellent speed and maintaining accuracy.

Due to lack of good support for mapping reads to alt-loci sequence, only the
primary assembly, including unlocalized sequence, is current evaluated.

The remapped alignments are discarded, only the splice junction output is
kept.  The results are filter to drop splice junction support small {\it
  maximum spliced alignment overhang}.
