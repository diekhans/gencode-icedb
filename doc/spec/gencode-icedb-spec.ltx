\section{Goals}
The goal of the Transcription Support Level (TSL) mechanism created for
GENCODE was to provide a simple, independent metric to answer the question
{\em how well supported is this annotation as transcribe in human.?}  

A short coming of the TSL approach was the inability to ask more detailed
questions about why something has a given level of support.  The goal of this
project is to address this shortcoming by building a database mapping evidence
to GENCODE annotations.  \todo{more}

\section{Data model}
single vs multi-exon transcripts
special cases
fuzzy ends and NAGNAG

Objects defined by GENCODE annotations:
\begin{tightitemize}
\item exon - includes NAGNAG annotations
\item intron - includes splice sites and NAGNAG annotations
\item transcript - linking introns and exons
\item gene - group transcripts
\item CDS - CDS regions of exons
\end{tightitemize}

Evidence mapped to GENCODE features:
\begin{tightitemize}
\item GenBank mRNA alignments
\item GenBank EST alignments to multi-exon genes
\item GenBank EST densities (wiggles) for single-exon genes
\item RNA-Seq 
\item protein spectra mapped to CDS
\end{tightitemize}



\section{Evidence sources}
\begin{tightitemize}
\item Human mRNAs:
\item Human ESTs:
\item RNA-Seq
\end{tightitemize}

\subsection{RNA-Seq evidence}

RNA-Seq mappings are analyzed to score support for introns (exon-pairs) in
GENCODE annotations.  In order to produce consistent mappings and analysis, 
selected RNA-Seq data is remapped to the genome using the GENCODE set as 
the target set.  The STAR \cite{Dobin25102012} mapper is use, which
has excellent speed and maintaining accuracy.

SJ.out.tab contains high confidence collapsed splice junctions in tab-delimited format. The columns have the following meaning:
column 1: column 2: column 3: column 4: column 5:
column 6:
column 7:
column 8:
chromosome
first base of the intron (1-based)
last base of the intron (1-based)
strand (0: undefined, 1: +, 2: -)
intron motif: 0: non-canonical; 1: GT/AG, 2: CT/AC, 3: GC/AG, 4: CT/GC, 5: AT/AC, 6: GT/AT
0: unannotated, 1: annotated (only if splice junctions database is used) number of uniquely mapping reads crossing the junction
number of multi-mapping reads crossing the junction
maximum spliced alignment overhang
column 9:
