  abstract =     {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq
                  data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of
                  the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short
                  read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the
                  sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq
                  aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping
                  speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To
                  align our large (exceeding 80 billon reads) ENCODE
                  Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset we developed the Spliced
                  Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based
                  on a previously un-described RNA-seq alignment algorithm
                  which utilizes sequential maximum mappable seed search in
                  uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and
                  stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by more
                  than a factor of 50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human
                  genome 550 Million 2x76bp paired-end reads per hour on a
                  modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving
                  alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased
                  de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover
                  non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and
                  is also capable of mapping full length RNA sequences. Using
                  Roche 454 sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons, we experimentally
                  validated 1,960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
                  80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the
                  STAR mapping strategy.Implementation and Availability: STAR
                  is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open
                  source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be
                  downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/Contact:
