- for a multi-exon transcript annotation:
    - For one piece of overlapping alignment evidence:
      - ignore if obviously not useful in providing support
      - build probable exon/intron list, combining small indels, splice junctions
      - compare with annotation



- Enhancements:
   - Add TSL override list, for things like 3-base exon
